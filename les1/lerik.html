            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>With a one-page personal website template like Knuford, you can wow and impress all your potential
                clients.
                Thanks to a solid and attention-grabbing page, you can immediately raise your potential, so don’t sit on
                it.
                Knuford is here to help you start working on your website without starting from square one. Due to its
                single-page structure, you can showcase all your services, portfolio, pricing and more in a few scrolls
                apart. FYI, this is a user-experience booster.</p>
            <p>In the Knuford bundle, you will discover many excellent features you can benefit from. Typewriter effect,
                floating navigation, on-scroll content loading, animated statistics, testimonials/references, and
                pricing plans are just some goodies you get. Knuford even includes Google Maps and a fully functional
                contact form.</p>

            <p>Please note: This is a Bootstrap 5 template that doesn’t come with a content management system or admin
                dashboard. An easier solution is to use a personal website builder with a drag-and-drop user interface,
                domain name and hosting.Please note: This is a Bootstrap 5 template that doesn’t come with a content
